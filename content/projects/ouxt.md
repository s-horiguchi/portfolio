OUXT Polaris is a team for the [Maritime RobotX Challenge](https://robotx.org/).


I was the team leader on [2018 Challenge](https://robotx.org/programs/2018-robotx-challenge/) at Honolulu. We received [judge's special award](https://robotx.org/2018/12/15/2018-final-standings/).

We were funded by Leave a Nest Co., Ltd. :
[The Nippon Foundation Marine Engineering Award](https://r.lne.st/2018/02/28/40th-deset/)
(第40回リバネス研究費 日本財団海洋工学賞), and seven companies.


We were also supported by crowdfunding at [academist](https://academist-cf.com/projects/77?lang=ja)
