I organized a programming tutorial for scientists with two other members of [WINGS-ABC](http://wings-abc.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp/).

[Tutorial Webpage](https://github.com/WINGS-ABC-programming-tutorial/tutorial-info)

The goal of this tutorial was to introduce a variety of know-how which is very common in expert programmers but not known among scientists. We covered the following topics:
* Sharing the code
* Environment setup (pip, pyenv, pipenv, Docker, VSCode)
* Parameter search and logging (mlflow)
* Version control
* Readability of the code
* Linter, Type checker
* Test, Unit test
* Reproducibility of Jupyter notebook

We also prepared sample codes for a deeper understanding of our tutorial.

* [sample_unittest](https://github.com/WINGS-ABC-programming-tutorial/sample_unittest)
