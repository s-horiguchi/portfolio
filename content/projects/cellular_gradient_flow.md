### How should cells behave to achieve a population-level goal?

I used the theory of generalized gradient flows to answer this question.
The resulting theoretical framework (cellular gradient flow) could explain single-cell-level rules (e.g., unidirectional differentiation) in multicellular systems as a result of population-level goal-directed behavior.
