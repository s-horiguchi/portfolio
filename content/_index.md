**Shuhei A. Horiguchi (堀口 修平) is an assistant professor** at Nano Life Science Institute  (Nano-LSI), Kanazawa University in [OKUDA LAB](http://mechgen.jp/index-en.html) led by Satoru Okuda.
I have obtained PhD in March 2024 at the University of Tokyo under the supervision of [Tetsuya J. Kobayashi](https://research.crmind.net).

I am interested in an analogy between artificial and biological systems.


**Research interest:**

 * Information processing in the multicellular system (e.g., immune system, nervous system, embryogenesis)
 * Robotics / Computer science
